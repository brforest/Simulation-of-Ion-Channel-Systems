# Simulation-of-Ion-Channel-Systems
A MATLAB program written to simulate the electrical behavior (e.g. voltage and current) of a system of ion channels.  Created and worked on between January and May of 2017.

.txt files are used to input and test different channel models, as well as to output the voltage and current information.  The output .txt files can be used to graph the electrical behavior of these different models.
